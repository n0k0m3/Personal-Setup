# Personal setup stash

This repo contains all of my personal codes and guides for personal setups. No personal info is here and most scripts work with all common consumer-based distros (Debian/Ubuntu, Arch, maybe RHEL-based, Fedora for some)

## Install ZSH
```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/n0k0m3/Personal-Setup/main/install_zsh.sh)"
```
