[This repo](https://github.com/n0k0m3/Personal-Setup) contains all of my personal codes and guides for personal setups. Most scripts target Arch-based distros (Arch Linux, Manjaro, EndeavourOS,...), although some guides work on all common Linux distros.

All scripts are written in Bash or Python, and are meant to be run from the command line. Every scripts used in guides will have its source code shown at the end of the guides.
